NETWORK Policy

by default any pod in cluster can communicate with any other pod in cluster on all ports but if we cant change the ports that a pod can accept or send traffic we create a netwrok policy and applied to a pod.

example network policy file to allow ingress traffic on port 3306 cat network-policy-3306.yaml -

apiVersion: networking.k8.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
   name: db-policy
spec:
   podSelector:
      matchLabels:
	     role: db <this policy is applied to all pods that contains tags as role: db>
   policyTypes:
   - ingress
   ingress:
   - from:
      - podSelector:
	     matchLabels:
		    name: api-pod
      ports:
      - portocol: TCP
        port: 3306	  
		
kubectl create -f network-policy-3306.yaml

command to see the network policies: kubectl get netpol

command to see the pods with labels : kubectl get pods -l name=payroll

the above files says that allow ingress traffic on port 3306 to pod rold: db from pod name: api-pod

Create a network policy to allow traffic from the Internal application only to the payroll-service and db-service.

Policy Name: internal-policy
Policy Type: Egress
Egress Allow: payroll
Payroll Port: 8080
Egress Allow: mysql
MySQL Port: 3306


apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: internal-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name: internal
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  - Ingress
  ingress:
    - {}
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: mysql
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306

  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: payroll
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080

  - ports:
    - port: 53
      protocol: UDP
    - port: 53
      protocol: TCP
	  
Note: We have also allowed Egress traffic to TCP and UDP port. This has been added to ensure that the internal DNS resolution works from the internal pod. Remember: The kube-dns service is exposed on port 53
