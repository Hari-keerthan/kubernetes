STATIC PODS - 
kubelet stores the pod definition files (yamls ) in /etc/kubernetes/manifests , you can get this path bye checking for --pod-manifest-path option in /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service, if u dont find the --pod-manifest-path option the chcek for the option --config and get the path of kubeconfig.yaml and in th ekubeconfig .yaml check for staticPodPath, one more way to find out path - ps -ef|grep kubelet |grep "\--config" , get the config file and grep for static in the config.yaml

kubelet chks this folder for yaml files and creates pods out of them
if we remove a yaml from this directory them pod is removed automatically

the pods that are created by kubelet without the intervension of the cluster components are call static pods

we can only create pods this way not any other service

usecase - useful to craete a master node

how to check for static pods in a cluster - 
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide
bow looks for the pods that have ending as nodename
